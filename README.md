# Improving-BERT-for-Biomedical-Question-Answering
This project explores whether it is possible to improve BERT for biomedical question answering by using different activations and answer-likelihood representations with different biomedical and non-biomedical variants in combinations never attempted before in the NLP field. The project's results deliver a simple but intriguing answer that it is not only possible, but it also exceeds the performance of current biomedical systems.

There are two main people involved in this project: Raphael Ivan Paras and Diego Molla-Aliod. The personal logbook of Raphael, the project software developer and researcher, and a record of this project's results can be found here: https://github.com/RaIvPa/Improving-BERT-for-Biomedical-QA/wiki. The Google Scholar of Diego, the project supervisor, can be found here: https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=FZhJRQUAAAAJ&hl=en.

This project also contains both files of code used to practice AI development and the actual code used in the project's experiments. For further information, please email Raphael at raphael.paras@students.mq.edu.au.
